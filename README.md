## About this Assessment 

This assessment is based on a series of tasks which are coded in python using Jupyter Notebook.
Each of these tasks is based on a different area of emerging technology.

## How to run this project
### Prerequisites:  Github, Jupyter-Notebook 

- Download the repository from GitHub
- Enter into the repository from your command line 
- Type the following: Jupyter notebook.
- The project should then be loaded.


## Task 1

The first task which is outlined as <b>Task 1</b> in my notebook is all about calculating the square root of a function. The task was to write a function called sqrt2 that calculates the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. The task was to be completed using the python standard library, so we were not able to import any modules or packages to do the work for us. My references for figuring out this task are also included in the notebook.

## Task 2

<b>Task 2</b> was based on the chi-squared test for independence. The task was to use scipy.stats to confirm that the Chi-Squared value of 24.6 was correct on a table provided to us and to calculate the associated p-value. References were also provided to justify my findings. All of which can be found in the notebook.

## Task 3

<b>Task 3</b> was to research the excel functions STDEV.P and STDEV.S and use this research to create a note which explained the difference between the two functions. We then had to use NumPy to perform a simulation which demonstrated that the STDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample. My findings and the code can be found in the notebook.

## Task 4
The aim for this task is to use scikit-learn to apply k-means clustering to Fisher’s Iris data set. Then to create a markdown cell and explain how the code works and how accurate it might be, and then explain how your model could be used to make predictions of species of iris.

### Fisher’s Iris data set

Classify's iris flowers among three species (<b>setosa, versicolor, or virginica</b>) from measurements of sepals and petals' length and width.

The iris data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
